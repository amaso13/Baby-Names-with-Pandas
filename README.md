# Baby-Names-with-Pandas
The data set of choice for this project  will be the U.S. Social Security baby name catalog, which reports on the number of male and female newborns that were given a certain name in each year since 1880. This is a simple dataset but also great fun to play with, learn pandas, and it has been mined, analyzed, and visualized in many publications and websites.
