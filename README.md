# Baby-Names-with-Pandas
The data set of choice for this project  will be the U.S. Social Security baby name catalog, which reports on the number of male and female newborns that were given a certain name in each year since 1880.
### Baby name frequency data from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-national-level-data. 
This website describes the data as "Public: This dataset is intended for public access and use."
### Dataset description from http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/background.html
"All names are from Social Security card applications for births that occurred in the United States after 1879. Note that many people born before 1937 never applied for a Social Security card, so their names are not included in our data. For others who did apply, our records may not show the place of birth, and again their names are not included in our data."
